# Kotlin Concurrency Example Project

This project demonstrates various concurrency techniques in Kotlin using coroutines. The examples include fetching and processing data concurrently, handling errors, and performing complex tasks.

## Introduction

Concurrency is the ability of a program to run multiple threads at the same time. This is important for handling large and complex operations more efficiently. This project explores concurrency in Kotlin and demonstrates how to manage it using clean code standards.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and build the project using Gradle.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kotlin_concurrency_example.git
cd kotlin_concurrency_example
./gradlew build
```

## Examples

### Main.kt

This file serves as the entry point of the project. It initializes the \`DataFetcher\` and \`DataProcessor\` classes and demonstrates various concurrency techniques.

```kotlin
fun main() = runBlocking {
    println("Starting the concurrency example project...")
    val time = measureTimeMillis {
        val fetcher = DataFetcher()
        val processor = DataProcessor()

        val data = fetcher.fetchData()

        val job1 = launch { processor.processData(data, 1) }
        val job2 = launch { processor.processData(data, 2) }
        val job3 = launch { processor.processData(data, 3) }
        
        joinAll(job1, job2, job3)
    }
    println("Completed in $time ms")
}
```

### Worker.kt

This file defines the \`Worker\` class, which performs various tasks concurrently.

```kotlin
class Worker(private val id: Int) {
    suspend fun performTask(taskName: String) {
        println("Worker \$id is performing task: \$taskName")
        delay(1000L)
        println("Worker \$id completed task: \$taskName")
    }
}
```

### DataFetcher.kt

This file defines the \`DataFetcher\` class, which simulates fetching data from different sources.

```kotlin
class DataFetcher {
    suspend fun fetchData(): List<String> = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        val deferredData = (1..5).map { 
            async {
                delay(500L)
                "Data \$it"
            }
        }
        deferredData.awaitAll()
    }
}
```

### DataProcessor.kt

This file defines the \`DataProcessor\` class, which processes the fetched data.

```kotlin
class DataProcessor {
    suspend fun processData(data: List<String>, workerId: Int) {
        for (item in data) {
            println("Worker \$workerId is processing: \$item")
            delay(200L)
        }
        println("Worker \$workerId completed processing.")
    }
}
```

### Utils.kt

This file contains utility functions used throughout the project.

```kotlin
object Utils {
    fun printMessage(message: String) {
        println("Utils: \$message")
    }
}
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests for this project, use the following command:

```bash
./gradlew test
```
